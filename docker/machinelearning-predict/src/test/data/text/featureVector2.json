{ "text": "Lasagne originated in Italy, traditionally ascribed to the city of Naples (Campania), where the first modern recipe was created in the Middle Ages and published in Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery), and became a traditional dish.[2] Traditional lasagne is made by interleaving layers of pasta with layers of sauce, made with rag√π, bechamel, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and chopped hard boiled eggs.[citation needed] In other regions and outside of Italy it is common to find lasagne made with ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, various meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), miscellaneous vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, mushrooms), and typically flavored with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked.",
